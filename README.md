# Hello-World-of-TinyML
Build and Deploy "Hello World" project for TinyML 

This project demonstrates a basic TinyML model running on a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, ESP32, STM32). It uses TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) to predict a simple mathematical function:

y = sin(x)

The model takes an input x and predicts y = sin(x) in real-time on an embedded device.

ðŸ“ŒFeatures
âœ… Runs an ML model on a microcontroller (TinyML).
âœ… Uses TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM).
âœ… Deploys a small neural network to predict y = sin(x).
âœ… Works on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, ESP32, STM32,Arduino UNO etc.

 First RUN python note book and Build your model ---
 Second Copy all the Weight and Biases ---
 Put that values to your Arduino Sketch
